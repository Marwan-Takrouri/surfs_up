***Overview of the statistical analysis:***

 Started by having a meeting with W. Avy coming up soon, so I am eager to start analyzing, impressing him is my one-way ticket to Oahu, 
Hawaii.
I know that my analysis can only be as good as my data, so the first step is to make sure I have the data downloaded correctly so that I can start exploring it , Being Organized was my first key of success in this step.
I will be using my data analysis skills and techniques with Python , Pandas and SQl to come the very best data analysis possible .


***Summary of My Analysis***
My dependencies were added in the next step, and I have connected the SQLite database, and my code is appropriately documented. It's time to start the analysis. woww

Now, let's think about precipitation. W. Avy is concerned about the amount of precipitation on Oahu. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that we lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather, it got to be nice out and about weather .

I know that I can set W. Avy's mind at ease by analyzing precipitation levels and showing him the cold, hard, data that backs up Oahu as the perfect place to surf i have the last 12 months of precipitation data already loaded into my SQLite database, so I am  ready to go.

W. Avy supplied you with the data he wants us to use and has asked you to look at a full year of data. When deciding how to parse the data, you remember that his favorite day is August 23, 2017, because it's the anniversary of the first time he ever went surfing and had ice cream on the same day. So, you decide to start the analysis there.

***Results:***

i have the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for our station W. Avy have asked us to share the results, so let's go above and beyond and create a visualization for him. Visualizing our data will allow us—and W. Avy—to notice trends, as well as draw more accurate conclusions from it. Soi I plotted the Data as well, and it shows as below:

[(54.0, 85.0, 71.66378066378067)]

W. Avy likes my analysis, but he wanted more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, that he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round , sound great , so I went ahead and sorted that out and Hola , it looks like the below pics .


Summary:
Based in the data analysis I think the decision of opening the Surf shop and Ice cream will be very profitable , a decision made based on my analysis outcome as detailed in the below statements .
i have checked in the analysis June and December to make sure that the year around statistics supports the analysis purpose and the maximum profit of the shop ,
A place like Hawaii with the below visitors trends, and the below data analysis trends :

June mean 74.9  degree  F  Standard Deviation of 3.25
December Mean 71.04 degree F Standard deviation of 3.74


June and december combined data of :
minimum temp of 56 degree F
max temp of 85 Degree F
